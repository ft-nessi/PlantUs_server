## User Stories

- **homepage** - As a user/ranger I want to be able to access the homepage to see what the app is about, to login and signup
- **sign up** - As a ranger I want to sign up so that I can start to mark the trees and see which trees were already planted. As a user I want to sign up so that I can see which trees should be planted, which trees I already planted and how much CO2 was absorbed by the trees that I planted.
- **login** - As a user/ranger I want to be able to login and access my profile (via email and password)

By clicking on a neutral location a window opens and you can see what kind of trees should be planted in the choosen location. You will also have a button to add the location to the planted tree list.
- **planted tree list user** - As a user I want to see a list of the planted trees. Each entry should have an edit button.
